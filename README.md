# Sacculina Genome Project
A workflow for genome assembly, annotation and differential expression analysis of Sacculina carcini

## Introduction

A few arthropods evolved towards an endoparasites and show a dramatic change in body shape and anatomy, often barely resembling arthropods at all. The parasitic barnacle Sacculina carcini (Crustacea: Rhizocephala) is one prominent example in evolutionary transformation due to an endoparasitic lifestyle. The adults show no sign of their arthropod kin: segmentation, appendages and most of the internal organs usually found in arthropods are completely missing. The adult body is divided into two parts: a network of rootlets growing in the body cavity of the crab hosts and a temporary breeding sac, bearing gonads and keeping first larval stages. There is a good record of studies on morphology and life cycle, but almost nothing is known about the genome of rhizocephalan species. 

This project aims to get a better understanding about the genetic and genomic foundations of this extreme modification of morphology. Assembly and annotation of the genome and differential gene expression focussing rootlet and breeding sac. Also a comparison to the standard repertoire of other arthropod genomes and a new survey genomes dataset of the non-parasitic barnacle Balanus amphitrite was performed.

Here we document the analysis steps and provide a snakmake workflow.
